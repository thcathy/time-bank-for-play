## Overview

Time Bank for Play uses a simple concept: **earn time by focusing, spend time by playing**. 

- Focus on productive activities (studying, working, learning) to deposit time into your "bank"
- Withdraw from your balance when you want to play games
- Play is only allowed when your balance is positive (configurable)

## Features

- **Tracking**: quick-add entries + stopwatch for real-time Focus/Play tracking
- **History**: browse, edit, and delete past entries
- **Analytics**: charts and stats (weekly focus vs play, balance trend, distribution)
- **Rules**: warning threshold, optional max play/day, allow overdraft toggle
- **Export**: export all entries to CSV (share sheet)
- **Local-first**: data stored locally on-device

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter 3.x** with Dart
- **Riverpod** for state management
- **Hive** for local storage (structured data)
- **SharedPreferences** for settings
- **go_router** for navigation
- **fl_chart** for analytics charts
- **Lucide Icons** for iconography
- **Google Fonts** (Inter) for typography

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thcathy/time-bank-for-play.git
   cd time-bank-for-play
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Build

```bash
# Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS IPA
flutter build ipa --release

# Web
flutter build web --release --no-wasm-dry-run
```

## Deploy (Web)

This repo includes a Cloudflare Pages deploy script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

It builds `build/web`, copies `privacy-policy.html`, then deploys via Wrangler.

## Release (Mobile)

This repo includes Fastlane lanes in `fastlane/Fastfile`:

```bash
# Android
fastlane android beta
fastlane android release

# iOS
fastlane ios build
fastlane ios beta
fastlane ios release
```

Notes:
- **Android**: while the app is still a **Draft app** in Play Console, internal uploads must use `release_status: "draft"` (already configured in `android beta`).
- **iOS**: you must update identifiers/team/profile names in `fastlane/*` to match your Apple Developer setup if you fork this repo.

## Secrets / signing (do not commit)

These are intentionally gitignored:
- `android/key.properties`
- `android/*.jks` (e.g. `android/upload-keystore.jks`)
- `fastlane/play-store-key.json`
- `*.p12`, `*.mobileprovision`, `*.cer`, `*.certSigningRequest`

See `android/key.properties.template` for the expected format.
